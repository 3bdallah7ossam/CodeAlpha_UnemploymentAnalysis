This project analyzes Indian unemployment data (2008-2020) using Python for cleaning, EDA, and visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Key steps include handling missing values, deriving time-based features, and computing statistics/correlations. Visuals reveal national trends with a 300% COVID-19 spike in 2020 (urban areas hardest hit), seasonal peaks in April-June due to agriculture, and regional variations (e.g., high in Haryana). Insights suggest policies like urban youth training and rural job diversification to mitigate economic vulnerabilities, aligning with CodeAlpha's Task 2 requirements.
